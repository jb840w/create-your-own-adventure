You swim into the cave.
A frightened squid pops up from one of the rocks of the cave and shoots ink to your eyes!
You are now short of breath AND cannot see a thing...

Do you try to [swim back up for air](../caught_up/plants.md) even though you are blind?

Do you try to [wipe the ink from your eye](wipe_the_ink/wipe_the_ink.md) and risk using all of your breath?
